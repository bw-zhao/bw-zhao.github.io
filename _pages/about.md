Hello, I'm currently a graduate student at Xidian University, specializing in multimodal clustering and multi-view clustering. With a focus on these areas, I'm deeply engaged in exploring the intersections of different data modalities and perspectives to derive meaningful insights and patterns. My academic journey thus far has been driven by a passion for understanding complex data structures and devising innovative solutions to real-world problems. I'm enthusiastic about leveraging cutting-edge techniques in machine learning and data mining to contribute to advancements in these fields. Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring new technologies, indulging in outdoor activities, and engaging in community initiatives. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to making meaningful contributions to the realm of data science and beyond.
